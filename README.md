# nyc-homelessness-risk-assessment

This algorithm generates a daily **homelessness risk score** for each ZIP code in New York City, helping nonprofits and outreach teams prioritize areas for intervention. It combines multiple public-data sources, including:

- **311 complaints related to homelessness**, capturing recent and recurring reports of unsheltered individuals  
- **Weather data**, accounting for extreme temperatures, precipitation, and other environmental hazards  
- **Historical housing patterns**, highlighting locations with persistent or seasonal risk  
- **Shelter location data**, providing context on nearby resources and service gaps  

The algorithm produces a **risk score per ZIP code** that reflects both immediate and ongoing factors contributing to vulnerability. Each high-risk area is accompanied by **human-readable explanations**, so users can understand why a location has been flagged and make informed decisions.  

Outputs are visualized as an **interactive heatmap**, highlighting the areas of greatest concern each day. The platform is designed to be **ethical, transparent, and fully privacy-conscious**, relying only on aggregated public data and avoiding individual profiling.  

This tool provides actionable insights to support **street outreach teams, shelters, and nonprofits** in efficiently allocating resources and responding to homelessness in New York City.
